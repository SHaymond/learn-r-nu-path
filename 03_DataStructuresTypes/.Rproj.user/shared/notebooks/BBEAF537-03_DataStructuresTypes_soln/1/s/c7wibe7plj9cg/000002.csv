# you don't need to understand this code right now, we're more focused on it's output

# create OLS linear regression model for ferritin and iron values from the NHANES iron marker data set
reg <- lm(Ft_ngdL ~ Fe_ugdL, data = nhanes_fe)
summary(reg) 

#look at our new variable, reg -- it is a list with 12 elements
# we can pull out the intercept and slope and the fitted values and the residuals, etc. - these are within the different named elements of the list

# if we want to inspect the coefficients for the linear equation
reg$coefficients

# we can even get more specific and pull out the intercept and the slope to use them in math operations or other things
reg$coefficients[1] #gets the intercept
reg$coefficients[2] #gets the slope

# We'll cover more on how to subset and select out specific elements or parts of data in the next session
