#alternatively, this also works
ex1_data <- read_xls(\"ex1.xls\")

# From the package documentation: read_excel() calls excel_format() to determine if path is xls or xlsx, based on the file extension and the file itself, in that order. Use read_xls() and read_xlsx() directly if you know better and want to prevent such guessing."
